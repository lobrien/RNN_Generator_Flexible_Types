# RNN_Generator_Flexible_Types

LSTM-based RNN that generates a sequence (perhaps chars, perhaps whole words, etc.)

Starting point was Chollet's [example](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/8.1-text-generation-with-lstm.ipynb) from his excellent book "Deep Learning in Python." 

At the moment the hyperparameters seem pretty poor to me.
